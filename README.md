# My online resume
 This project features my online resume page built in the scope of Udacity "Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree" projects.

## Description of the project
Using jQuery, developed an interactive resume application that reads all data from a JSON file and then dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information. Further customized the project by personalizing the design using CSS.
